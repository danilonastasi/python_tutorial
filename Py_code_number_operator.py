9 / 2 # result will be a float number

0b11111111 # converfting from binary system, prefix is 0b

0o377  # converting from ott system, prefix is 0o

0xFF # converting from hex system, prefix is 0x

9 // 4 # result will be 2, integer division

9 % 4 # result will be 1, the rest of the division, modul

8 == 8 # is it equal?

3 == 5

3 != 5 # is it different?

8 != 8

3 < 5 # is 3 less than 5? idem > bigger

3 <= 5 # is 3 less or equal to 5? idem >= bigger/equal


# let's type Booleans operator
# AND  --> retur True if both operandi are true, if not return False
# OR --> return True is at least one of the operandi is true, if not return False
# NOT --> return False if operando is true, return True if operand is False


# in Python every object is or True(numbers different from 0, costant True, containers with at least one element)
# or False(it means the number 0, costant False and None, empty containers)

# bool(object), bool is a function to verify if the object is True or False.

# if the first Boolena operator (AND, OR or other) is the one can find the result, the second operator is not run.


# Binary operators, bitwise

x << n # run a shift to the left of n positions of the bit x
x >> n # run a shift to the right of n positions of the bit x
x & y # run a AND between bit x and bit y
x | y # run OR between bit x and bit y
x ^ y # run exclusive OR between bit x and bit y
~x # invert bit of x

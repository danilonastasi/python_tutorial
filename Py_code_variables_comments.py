# Variables and comments in Python

numero = 10
stringa = "Python"
lista = [1, 2, 3]
# as you can see we don't need to declare variables

x = 10
x = 20
# the value '10' will be deleted

x = 10
x = "Python"
x = [1, 2, 3]
# the final association is the last one which is a list

# let's make a multiple assignment
a, b, c = 2, 3, 5 # multiple assignment
a * b + c
a
b
c
